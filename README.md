# Sentiment-Analyzer

Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a crucial task in natural language processing, aiming
 to comprehend individuals' sentiments towards specific aspects or features of products or
 services. In this project, we delve into ABSA using the SemEval restaurants' dataset, a widely
 recognized benchmark in the field. Our study focuses on developing and evaluating machine
 learning and deep learning models to accurately identify and classify sentiments expressed
 towards various aspects of restaurant experiences, such as food quality, service, ambiance, and
 price. Through rigorous experimentation and analysis, we aim to uncover effective strategies and
 techniques for ABSA, contributing to advancements in sentiment analysis and enhancing our
 understanding of customer feedback in the restaurant domain.
